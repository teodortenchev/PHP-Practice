# PHP Calculator



This PHP calculator was created using Symphony MVC framework. An overkill, yes, but also a good way to introduce myself to the MVC model and working with Symphony within PHP Storm.

  - It can do basic functions like multiplication, subtraction, division...
  - Uses the TWIG view engine
  - Runs by using magic, I've got no idea, thank God for all the documentation and the **skeleton** provided to me by SoftUni.

# TODO!
These are just some things I would love to add if I get a moment.
  - Add log in fuctionality with a simple backend
  - View previous calculations done by any user. Look up by user. 
  - This would require me to use MySQL (Doctrine + XAMPP to the rescue!).
